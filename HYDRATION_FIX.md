# Hydration Error Fix

## Problem
The application was experiencing hydration errors due to server-client mismatches in dynamic components.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **AnimatedCounter component** was using `Date.now()` which creates different values on server vs client
2. **Carousel components** with auto-play functionality starting immediately
3. **Dynamic state initialization** in client components

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed AnimatedCounter Component
- Replaced `Date.now()` with `requestAnimationFrame` timestamp
- Added `isMounted` state to prevent animation until after hydration
- Added fallback rendering for SSR

### 2. Created ClientOnly Wrapper
- New component: `src/components/ui/ClientOnly.tsx`
- Prevents rendering of client-only components until after hydration
- Provides fallback content during SSR

### 3. Updated Home Page
- Wrapped `HeroCarousel` and `TestimonialSection` with `ClientOnly`
- Added appropriate fallback content

## Usage

### For components with dynamic behavior:
```tsx
import { ClientOnly } from '@/components/ui/ClientOnly';

<ClientOnly fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
  <DynamicComponent />
</ClientOnly>
```

### For components with timers/intervals:
```tsx
const [isMounted, setIsMounted] = useState(false);

useEffect(() => {
  setIsMounted(true);
}, []);

// Only start timers after mounting
useEffect(() => {
  if (!isMounted) return;
  // Timer logic here
}, [isMounted]);
```

## Testing
After implementing these fixes:
1. The hydration error should be resolved
2. Components will render correctly on both server and client
3. No functionality is lost, just delayed until after hydration

## Best Practices
1. Always use `ClientOnly` for components with browser-specific APIs
2. Initialize dynamic state as `false` or `null` and update after mounting
3. Avoid `Date.now()`, `Math.random()`, or other non-deterministic functions in render
4. Use `useEffect` to detect client-side mounting before starting animations
