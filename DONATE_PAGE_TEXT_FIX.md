# Donate Page Text Visibility Fix

## Problem
The donate page had grey and white text that was difficult to read, particularly in form elements and various UI components.

## Issues Identified
1. **Light grey text** (`text-gray-600`) with poor contrast
2. **Form inputs** without explicit text colors (inheriting white text)
3. **Select dropdown** without proper text styling
4. **UI elements** using light grey colors that were hard to read

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Fixed Text Color Contrast
**Before**: `text-gray-600` (poor contrast)
**After**: `text-gray-700` or `text-gray-800` (better contrast)

### 2. Fixed Form Input Fields
**Before:**
```tsx
className="w-full px-3 py-3 border rounded-lg focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500"
```

**After:**
```tsx
className="w-full px-3 py-3 border rounded-lg focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500 text-gray-900 bg-white placeholder-gray-500"
```

### 3. Fixed Select Dropdown
**Before:**
```tsx
className="w-full px-3 py-2 border border-gray-300 rounded-md focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500"
```

**After:**
```tsx
className="w-full px-3 py-2 border border-gray-300 rounded-md focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500 text-gray-900 bg-white"
```

## Color Standards Applied

### Text Colors Used:

- **text-gray-800** (#1F2937) - Important descriptions and labels
- **text-gray-700** (#374151) - Secondary text and UI elements
- **placeholder-gray-500** (#6B7280) - Placeholder text in inputs
- **bg-white** (#FFFFFF) - Form field backgrounds

### Contrast Ratios:
- **text-gray-900**: 16.8:1 (Excellent - WCAG AAA)
- **text-gray-800**: 12.6:1 (Excellent - WCAG AAA)
- **text-gray-700**: 9.6:1 (Excellent - WCAG AA)
- **placeholder-gray-500**: 4.5:1 (Good - WCAG AA)

## Global Form Protection
The global CSS rules added earlier also protect these form elements:

```css
input[type="text"],
input[type="email"],
input[type="tel"],
select {
  color: #111827 !important;
  background-color: #ffffff !important;
}

input::placeholder {
  color: #6B7280 !important;
}
```
