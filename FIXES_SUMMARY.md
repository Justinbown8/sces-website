### 2. Grey Text Visibility Issues ✅
**Problem**: Impact page and other sections had grey text that was difficult to read

**Solution**:

- Updated text contrast to meet WCAG AA standards
- Fixed in previous updates:
  - `text-text-light` → `text-gray-700` (better contrast)
  - `text-text-gray` → `text-gray-800` (high contrast)
  - `text-foreground` → `text-gray-800` (maximum contrast)
